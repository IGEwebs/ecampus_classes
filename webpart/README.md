## Manually installing and configuring Custom Learning for Office 365
The Microsoft Custom Learning Web Part is build using the [SharePoint Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview) version 1.7.1. To manually install and configure the web part and site collection you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Validate that you have met all the prerequisites.
2. Install the **customlearning.sppkg** file in your Office 365 Tenant App Catalog.
3. Provision/Identify a modern communication site to act as your Custom Learning for Office 365 home site.
4. Add the Custom Learning for Office 365 app to the site
5. Execute a PowerShell script that will configure your tenant with the appropriate artifacts that Custom Learning depends on.
6. Navigate to the CustomLearningAdmin.aspx site page to load the admin web part to initialize the custom content configuration.

### Prerequisites
You must have set up and configured the tenant-wide App Catalog. Please see [Set up your Office 365 tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant#create-app-catalog-site) and follow the Create app catalog site section. If your tenant-wide App Catalog has already been provisioned, you will need access to an account that has rights to upload a package to it to complete this setup process. Generally, this is an account with the SharePoint administrator role. If an account with that role does not work, go to the SharePoint admin center and find the Site Collection Administrators for the app catalog site collection and either log in as one of the Site Collection Administrators, or add the SharePoint administrator account that failed to the Site Collection Administrators. You will also need access to an account that is a SharePoint Tenant Admin.

### Install WebPart in Tenant App Catalog

To install the Custom Learning for Office 365 solution you will upload the **customlearning.sppkg** file to the tenant-wide App Catalog and deploy it. Please see [Use the App Catalog to make custom business apps available for your SharePoint Online environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/use-app-catalog) for detailed instructions on how to add an app to the app catalog.

### Provision/Identify Modern Communication Site

Either identify an existing, or provision a new, modern communication site in your SharePoint Online tenant. For more information about how to provision a communication site see [Create a communication site](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-communication-site-in-sharepoint-online-7fb44b20-a72f-4d2c-9173-fc8f59ba50eb) in SharePoint Online and follow the steps to create a communication site.

You will want to add everyone who should be able to view content to the Visitors group and everyone who should be able to administer custom playlists to the Members group. To configure the site for Custom Learning the first time the user must be either a site collection administrator or part of the Owners group.

## Add the Custom Learning for Office 365 app to the site
1. From the SharePoint site, click the System menu, then click **Add an App**.
2. Under **Your Apps**, click **From Your Organization**, and then click **Custom Learning for Office 365**.

### Execute PowerShell Configuration Script

A PowerShell script, **CustomLearningConfiguration.ps1**, is included that you will need to execute to create three [tenant properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/tenant-properties) that the solution uses. In addition the script creates two [single part app pages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/single-part-app-pages) in the site pages library to host the admin and user web parts at a known location.

### Initialize web part custom configuration

After the PowerShell script is successfully run, navigate to <YOUR-SITE-COLLECTION-URL>/SitePages/CustomLearningAdmin.aspx to initialize the CustomConfig list item that sets up Custom Learning for first use.
The configuration is now complete. You can move forward with using Custom Learning for Office 365. Please see the user documentation for more information.
